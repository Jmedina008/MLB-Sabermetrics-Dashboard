## 🎓 Advanced Metrics Explained

### Key Sabermetrics Calculations

**wOBA (Weighted On-Base Average)**
- Measures overall offensive value per plate appearance
- Scale: ~0.320 league average, higher is better
- Formula: Linear weights applied to different offensive outcomes

**wRC+ (Weighted Runs Created Plus)**
- Offensive production compared to league average
- Scale: 100 = average, 115 = 15% above average
- Park and league adjusted

**ISO (Isolated Power)**
- Raw power measurement isolating extra-base hits
- Formula: Slugging Percentage - Batting Average
- Scale: ~0.140 average, 0.200+ excellent

**FIP (Fielding Independent Pitching)**
- Pitcher performance excluding defensive impact
- Focus on strikeouts, walks, home runs allowed
- Better predictor than ERA for future performance
