# MLB Sabermetrics Dashboard ⚾

**"Numbers don't lie, but they tell stories."**

As a lifelong baseball fan who grew up arguing about whether Derek Jeter was clutch or just lucky, I built this dashboard to settle debates with actual data. Tired of hearing "he passes the eye test" when advanced metrics tell a completely different story? This tool digs deep into the numbers that actually matter.

Whether you're trying to prove that Mike Trout is having a historic season, understand why your favorite pitcher's ERA doesn't match his FIP, or settle that endless debate about which player deserves the MVP, this dashboard has the advanced metrics to back up your arguments.

## 📊 What This Dashboard Does

Ever wonder why your team's $300M payroll isn't translating to wins? Or why that prospect everyone's hyping has a .127 ISO? This dashboard cuts through the noise with the metrics that actually predict success:

- **Player Deep Dives**: Is Acuña really as good as his stats suggest? (Spoiler: Yes, and then some)
- **Head-to-Head Battles**: Finally settle who's better - Betts or Judge? (The numbers might surprise you)
- **Pitcher Reality Check**: That 2.50 ERA looks great, but what's his FIP saying about regression?
- **Team Building Insights**: See which teams are getting actual value vs. paying for past performance
- **Sabermetrics Made Simple**: No more wondering what the hell wRC+ means - I'll show you why it matters

**Real talk**: This isn't just another stats site. It's built by someone who's been in those 2 AM Baseball-Reference rabbit holes trying to prove a point about why OBP matters more than batting average.

### What the Numbers Actually Tell Us

Let's look at Acuña's 2023 season - the one where everyone knew he was special, but the numbers show just HOW special:

```bash
⚾ RONALD ACUÑA JR. - THE UNICORN SEASON

🔥 WHAT YOU SAW:
  41 home runs, 73 stolen bases (first 40/70 since 1988!)
  .337 average that had Braves fans losing their minds
  
🧮 WHAT THE ADVANCED STATS REVEAL:
  wRC+ of 169 = 69% better than average (that's bonkers)
  wOBA of .435 = elite offensive value every single plate appearance
  ISO of .280 = legitimate 30+ HR power
  BABIP of .387 = some luck, but also incredible speed/contact skills

💡 THE VERDICT: 
Not just MVP-caliber - this was a historically great season.
That wRC+ puts him in company with peak Bonds, Trout, and Babe Ruth.
Yeah, it's THAT good.
```

**Why this matters**: When your casual fan friend says "but he struck out 105 times," you can show them why a 169 wRC+ makes strikeouts almost irrelevant. The dude created runs at an elite level every time he stepped in the box.

## 🧠 The Metrics That Actually Matter (And Why)

### Breaking Down the Numbers That Separate Pretenders from Contenders

**wOBA - The "True Hitting" Metric**
Think of it as batting average's smarter cousin. While BA treats a single and home run the same, wOBA actually weighs each outcome by how much it helps you score runs. A .350 wOBA is roughly equivalent to a .350 OBP, but it's accounting for power too.
*Real talk*: If someone has a .400 wOBA, they're having an elite offensive season, period.

**wRC+ - The Great Equalizer**
This is your "park and era adjusted" offensive rating. 100 = league average, so 130 means 30% better than average. It accounts for Coors Field inflating numbers and pitcher-friendly parks deflating them.
*Why it matters*: When someone says "but he plays in a hitter's park," wRC+ already factored that in.

**ISO - The Power Detective**
ISO strips away singles and just shows you raw power. It's literally SLG minus AVG. A .200 ISO means legitimate power, .250+ is elite territory.
*The test*: If a guy has a .300 average but only .120 ISO, he's a slap hitter getting lucky.

**FIP - The Pitcher Truth Serum**
ERA can lie. Your defense might be amazing, you might be getting lucky on balls in play, but FIP only looks at what you control: strikeouts, walks, and home runs. If someone has a 2.50 ERA but 4.20 FIP, bet on regression.
*Scouts hate this one trick*: FIP often predicts next season's ERA better than current ERA does.

## 🍻 The Bottom Line

I built this because I'm tired of arguing with people who think pitcher wins matter and that RBIs tell you everything about a hitter's value. Baseball is beautiful precisely because the numbers reveal stories that the naked eye misses.

Sure, this started as a portfolio project, but it became something more: a tool for anyone who's ever been in a bar argument about whether Juan Soto is actually as good as his OBP suggests (he is), or why your team's ace might not be as dominant as his ERA indicates.

The game has evolved beyond batting average and RBIs. The teams that understand advanced metrics are the ones building sustainable winners. This dashboard is for fans who want to understand the game the way front offices do.

*Built by a fan, for fans who love the numbers as much as the game.*
